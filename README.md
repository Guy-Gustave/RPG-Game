### Design Process

GetCoins design process started with the idea of creating a simple and beautiful RPG.  I got inspired by the RPG classic the supermario. and thanks to opengameart.org  for posting all of these amazing spirites and tiels  used in the game.

the game entire map was built with Tiled on a 32 x 32 collection other than the cowboy that was built on 45 x 44   of squares.
first I created player and coins to get scores then I added the fire so the player will have some obstacles to run from.

$ All tests will pass ‚úÖ
